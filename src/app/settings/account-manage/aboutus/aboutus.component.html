      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
        As a software engineering student, I wanted to create a project that combines two of my greatest interests—
        technology and anime. AniStream is the result of countless hours spent coding, designing, and optimizing a platform
        that demonstrates both front-end and back-end development skills. From responsive design to user-friendly
        navigation, this site was built with modern tools and technologies such as <strong>Angular</strong>,
        <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and more.
